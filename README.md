The script works well on 1.5.5 and 1.7.3.

## Edit the script to answers these questions:
+ Will you install on VM or Docker? What is your virtual IP?
+ Which folder will the server be installed in?
+ Will you download the game server or use an existing archive file? What is the archive file name?

## Run the script to install the server.
+ Is your game server version 1.5.x (32bit)?
  - If so, after running the script, you must override your file /lib/libtask.so with /pwtools/additional-libs/lib32/libtask.so manually.

Finished!
